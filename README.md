# qss-compiler: An MLIR based quantum compiler for control systems

The qss-compiler is an MLIR based quantum control system compiler with support for OpenQASM 3. It is designed to compile quantum programs to real quantum hardware and is designed as part the overall Quantum Engine.

## Building
We use [Conan](https://docs.conan.io/en/1.59/index.html) to build the compiler and handle dependencies.

To build:

1. `git clone git@github.com:Qiskit/qss-compiler.git && cd qss-compiler`
2. Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
3. Export local Conan recipe dependencies to Conan: `./conan_deps.sh`
4. `mkdir build && cd build`
5. Install Conan dependencies: `conan install .. --build=outdated -pr:h default -pr:b default`
6. Invoke the build with Conan: `conan build ..`. This will build the compiler.
7. To run tests: `conan build .. --test`

Alternatively instead of steps 6/7, you can build directly with CMake (also from within the build folder):
1. Configure - `cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=conan_toolchain.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release" ..`
2. Build - `ninja`
3. Check tests - `ninja check-tests`

### Python library
The `qss-compiler` Python library will be installed by default to the resolved environment Python when
installing with conan. To disable add the option `conan build .. -o pythonlib=False`.

### Platforms
#### Windows
Building and running the compiler is supported with [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
