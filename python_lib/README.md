# Python API for the [QSS Compiler](../README.md)

This `python_lib` subdirectory of the
[qss-compiler](https://github.ibm.com/IBM-Q-Software/qss-compiler/) provides python
bindings for the qss-compiler API. In particular, it creates a python
package called `qss_compiler` that exposes two functions that compile input from a string or from a file, respectively:

```
compile_str(input_str: str,
             compile_options: Optional[CompileOptions],
             **kwargs,
) -> Union[bytes, str, None]

compile_file(input_file: str,
             compile_options: Optional[CompileOptions],
             **kwargs,
) -> Union[bytes, str, None]`
```

Both support delivering the compiler's output by returning a byte sequence (i.e., python's `bytes`) or by writing to a file. See the tests in `test/python_lib/test_compile.py` for examples of the supported combinations of input and output (note that the combinations in these examples are not exhaustive).

For generating payloads (`OutputType.QEM`), the functions must be called with a valid `target` and path to configuration (`config_path`), which is also demonstrated in the tests.


## Installation

### From IBM internal PyPI
For Linux machines, you can install pyQSSC from our internal PyPI:

    pip install qss-compiler --extra-index-url=<your_username>:<your_artifactory_api_key>@na.artifactory.swg-devops.com/artifactory/api/pypi/res-quantum-team-pypi-local/simple

where `<your_username>` is your w3id (eg., `first.last@ibm.com`), and `<your_artifactory_api_key>` is found on [this page](https://na.artifactory.swg-devops.com/ui/admin/artifactory/user_profile). More instructions can be found [here](https://github.ibm.com/IBM-Q-Software/qss-compiler#docker-setup-instructions). For other platforms, please continue installing from source.


### From source

Follow the instructions [here](https://github.ibm.com/IBM-Q-Software/qss-compiler#building) to download and build `qss-compiler` locally. The build step also prepares a directory `python_lib` inside your build directory that can be used to build the python package.

To install the package in the current virtual environment, from `<build dir>/qss-compiler/python_lib`, run:

    pip install .

For development, we recommend a so-called _editable_ install that links back to the work tree.

    pip install -e .

Note that when you change python or C++ source files, you need to first re-build `qss-compiler` (i.e., run `make` or `ninja`) so that the changes become visible in the build directory, before rebuilding or reinstalling the python package.

The build system copies over python source files and all other files required to building the python package to `<build dir>/python_lib`. Also, the build system generates a shared library file containing the QSSC python module. Specifically, you should see a file in `<build dir>/python_lib/qss_compiler/` named like `py_qssc.cpython-<pyversion>-<arch>.so` (e.g. `py_qssc.cpython-39-darwin.so`).
The reason for that indirection is that python cannot collect files from different directories when building a package. Thus, the generated shared library and the python source files from the source tree need to be moved to the same directory hierarchy.


### Deployment

When a tag is pushed, the CI builds and pushes python wheels to our internal pypi repo within artifactory [here](https://na.artifactory.swg-devops.com/ui/repos/tree/General/res-quantum-team-pypi-local%2Fqss-compiler).

The name of the wheel is `qss-compiler-<version>`.


## Testing

From the `qss-compiler` directory, after installation, simply run:

    pytest test/python_lib
