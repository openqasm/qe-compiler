    Support for `MLIR Bytecode <https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/BytecodeFormat/>`_ has been
    added to the qe-compiler for both input and output to the CLI and C++/Python APIs.
    To take bytecode as input treat it as normal MLIR, the compiler will automatically
    detect if it is bytecode or the MLIR textual format. Bytecode input may be explicitly
    specified with ``./qss-compiler -X=bytecode ...``.
    To emit bytecode from the compiler ``./qss-compiler ... -o test.bc`` or
    ``./qss-compiler ... --emit bytecode -o file.bc``

    The core qss-compiler compile API has been rewritten and refactored to align with
    MLIROptMain. This enables better forward compatiability and integration with
    MLIR bytecode through the compiler and its Python bindings.
