    Added the ability to easily return QSSC diagnostics from the standard MLIR diagnostic mechanisms
    and callback handlers through easy to use helper methods. It is now possible to write code like:

    .. code-block:: cpp

        qssc::emitError(op, qssc::ErrorCategory::OpenQASM3UnsupportedInput) << "Error message \n";

    The diagnostic will be treated like a normal MLIR diagnostic but will also encode the QSSC
    information to be decoded by the compiler's diagnostic handlers.
