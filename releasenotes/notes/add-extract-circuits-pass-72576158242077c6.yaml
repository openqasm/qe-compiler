features:
  - |
    Add new ExtractCircuitsPass. This pass will walk the main func and extract
    quantum operations into quir.circuits. It is intended to be run after all
    reordering and merging has been completed. The pass currently requires
    --enable-circuits=true in order to have effect.
deprecations:
  - |
    Circuit formation during QUIRGen has been deprecated. This form of circuit
    generation is now controlled by the --enable-circuits-from-qasm command
    line option.
